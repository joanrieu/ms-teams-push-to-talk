# Push-to-talk for Microsoft Teams

Global keyboard shortcut to talk in a meeting without wasting time to find the right window and the right toolbar button.

## Usage

Press F9 to put the meeting window in the foreground.

Hold F9 to temporarily unmute yourself (you will be muted again once you release F9).

## Installation

The repository contains an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) script for Windows.

A precompiled executable can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/joanrieu/ms-teams-push-to-talk/releases) pages.

Once launched, the script will run in the background.

To run it automatically when your computer starts, put it in your Startup folder.
